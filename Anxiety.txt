Symptoms of a panic attack
If you experience sudden, intense anxiety and fear, it might be the symptoms of a panic attack. Other symptoms may include:
a racing heartbeat
feeling faint, dizzy or lightheaded
feeling that you're losing control
sweating, trembling or shaking
shortness of breath or breathing very quickly
a tingling in your fingers or lips
feeling sick (nausea)
A panic attack usually lasts 5 to 30 minutes. They can be frightening, but they're not dangerous and should not harm you.

Things you can try to help with anxiety, fear and panic

Don’t
do not try to do everything at once – set small targets that you can easily achieve
do not focus on the things you cannot change – focus your time and energy into helping yourself feel better
do not avoid situations that make you anxious – try slowly building up time spent in worrying situations to gradually reduce anxiety
try not to tell yourself that you're alone; most people experience anxiety or fear at some point in their life
try not to use alcohol, cigarettes, gambling or drugs to relieve anxiety as these can all contribute to poor mental health
