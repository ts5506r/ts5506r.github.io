Lots of people deal with anxiety — it’s nothing to be ashamed of. And it can get better with treatment.
There are therapies and medicines for anxiety. Getting treatment is the best thing you can do.
I know asking for help can be hard, but getting treatment can help you get back to your normal activities.
Offer to help.

You can say:
I want to help you through this. Can I help you make an appointment with your doctor?
How can I best support you?
You can call or text me anytime if you need support — or if you just want to talk.
Moving your body can help you manage your stress and feel better. Do you want to meet for a walk on Saturday?
You might feel better if you talk to people who are going through the same things as you. Can I help you find a support group?

Ask life-saving questions.
Many people who have anxiety also have depression. Check in on your friend or loved one with anxiety. 
For example, you might ask: Do you feel safe? or Have you felt hopeless or thought about hurting yourself recently?
