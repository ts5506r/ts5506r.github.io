How to tell if you have depression
Depression manifests in various ways, including persistent feelings of unhappiness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. 
It can also involve anxiety and physical symptoms like fatigue, poor sleep, lack of appetite or sex drive, and aches and pains. The severity of symptoms ranges from mild, 
characterized by a persistent low mood, to severe, where individuals may feel life is not worth living and have suicidal thoughts. While many people experience stress, anxiety, 
or low mood during tough times, these feelings typically improve over time and do not necessarily indicate depression.

Living with depression
Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily.
Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed.
Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive.
