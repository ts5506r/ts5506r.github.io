Causes of stress
Stress is usually a reaction to mental or emotional pressure. It's often related to feeling like you're losing control over something, but sometimes there's no obvious cause.
When you're feeling anxious or scared, your body releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.
This can be helpful for some people and stress might help you get things done or feel more motivated.
But it might also cause physical symptoms such as a faster heartbeat or sweating. If you're stressed all the time it can become a problem.

Identifying the cause
If you know what's causing your stress it might be easier to find ways to manage it.
Some examples of things that may cause stress include:
work – feeling pressure at work, unemployment or retirement
family – relationship difficulties, divorce or caring for someone
financial problems – unexpected bills or borrowing money
health – illness, injury or losing someone (bereavement)
Even significant life events such as buying a house, having a baby or planning a wedding could lead to feelings of stress.
You might find it hard to explain to people why you feel this way, but talking to someone could help you find a solution.

What is stress?
Stress is the body's reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure.
When we are stressed, our body releases a hormone called adrenaline (often called the "fight or flight" hormone), which usually gives us a boost or motivates us to act quickly.
But too much stress can affect our mood, our body and our relationships – especially when it feels out of our control. It can make us feel anxious and irritable, and affect our self-esteem.
Experiencing long-term stress or severe stress can lead to feeling physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called "burnout"
